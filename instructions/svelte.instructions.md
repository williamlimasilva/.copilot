# Svelte 5 and SvelteKit Development Instructions

Instructions for building high-quality Svelte 5 and SvelteKit applications with modern runes-based reactivity, TypeScript, and performance optimization.

## Project Context

- Svelte 5.x with runes system ($state, $derived, $effect, $props, $bindable)
- SvelteKit for full-stack applications with file-based routing
- TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience
- Component-scoped styling with CSS custom properties
- Progressive enhancement and performance-first approach
- Modern build tooling (Vite) with optimizations

## Core Concepts

### Architecture

- Use Svelte 5 runes system for all reactivity instead of legacy stores
- Organize components by feature or domain for scalability
- Separate presentation components from logic-heavy components
- Extract reusable logic into composable functions
- Implement proper component composition with slots and snippets
- Use SvelteKit's file-based routing with proper load functions

### Component Design

- Follow single responsibility principle for components
- Use `<script lang="ts">` with runes syntax as default
- Keep components small and focused on one concern
- Implement proper prop validation with TypeScript annotations
- Use `{#snippet}` blocks for reusable template logic within components
- Use slots for component composition and content projection
- Pass `children` snippet for flexible parent-child composition
- Design components to be testable and reusable

## Reactivity and State

### Svelte 5 Runes System

- Use `$state()` for reactive local state management
- Implement `$derived()` for computed values and expensive calculations
- Use `$derived.by()` for complex computations beyond simple expressions
- Use `$effect()` sparingly - prefer `$derived` or function bindings for state sync
- Implement `$effect.pre()` for running code before DOM updates
- Use `untrack()` to prevent infinite loops when reading/writing same state in effects
- Define component props with `$props()` and destructuring with TypeScript annotations
- Use `$bindable()` for two-way data binding between components
- Migrate from legacy stores to runes for better performance
- Override derived values directly for optimistic UI patterns (Svelte 5.25+)

### State Management

- Use `$state()` for local component state
- Implement type-safe context with `createContext()` helper over raw `setContext`/`getContext`
- Use context API for sharing reactive state down component trees
- Avoid global `$state` modules for SSR - use context to prevent cross-request data leaks
- Use SvelteKit stores for global application state when needed
- Keep state normalized for complex data structures
- Prefer `$derived()` over `$effect()` for computed values
- Implement proper state persistence for client-side data

### Effect Best Practices

- **Avoid** using `$effect()` to synchronize state - use `$derived()` instead
- **Do** use `$effect()` for side effects: analytics, logging, DOM manipulation
- **Do** return cleanup functions from effects for proper teardown
- Use `$effect.pre()` when code must run before DOM updates (e.g., scroll position)
- Use `$effect.root()` for manually controlled effects outside component lifecycle
- Use `untrack()` to read state without creating dependencies in effects
- Remember: async code in effects doesn't track dependencies after `await`

## SvelteKit Patterns

### Routing and Layouts

- Use `+page.svelte` for page components with proper SEO
- Implement `+layout.svelte` for shared layouts and navigation
- Handle routing with SvelteKit's file-based system

### Data Loading and Mutations

- Use `+page.server.ts` for server-side data loading and API calls
- Implement form actions in `+page.server.ts` for data mutations
- Use `+server.ts` for API endpoints and server-side logic
- Use SvelteKit's load functions for server-side and universal data fetching
- Implement proper loading, error, and success states
- Handle streaming data with promises in server load functions
- Use `invalidate()` and `invalidateAll()` for cache management
- Implement optimistic updates for better user experience
- Handle offline scenarios and network errors gracefully

### Forms and Validation

- Use SvelteKit's form actions for server-side form handling
- Implement progressive enhancement with `use:enhance`
- Use `bind:value` for controlled form inputs
- Validate data both client-side and server-side
- Handle file uploads and complex form scenarios
- Implement proper accessibility with labels and ARIA attributes

## UI and Styling

### Styling

- Use component-scoped styles with `<style>` blocks
- Implement CSS custom properties for theming and design systems
- Use `class:` directive for conditional styling
- Follow BEM or utility-first CSS conventions
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Use `:global()` sparingly for truly global styles

### Transitions and Animations

- Use `transition:` directive for enter/exit animations (fade, slide, scale, fly)
- Use `in:` and `out:` for separate enter/exit transitions
- Implement `animate:` directive with `flip` for smooth list reordering
- Create custom transitions for branded motion design
- Use `|local` modifier to trigger transitions only on direct changes
- Combine transitions with keyed `{#each}` blocks for list animations

## TypeScript and Tooling

### TypeScript Integration

- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json` for maximum type safety
- Annotate props with TypeScript: `let { name }: { name: string } = $props()`
- Type event handlers, refs, and SvelteKit's generated types
- Use generic types for reusable components
- Leverage `$types.ts` files generated by SvelteKit
- Implement proper type checking with `svelte-check`
- Use type inference where possible to reduce boilerplate

### Development Tools

- Use ESLint with eslint-plugin-svelte and Prettier for code consistency
- Use Svelte DevTools for debugging and performance analysis
- Keep dependencies up to date and audit for security vulnerabilities
- Document complex components and logic with JSDoc
- Follow Svelte's naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions)

## Production Readiness

### Performance Optimization

- Use keyed `{#each}` blocks for efficient list rendering
- Implement lazy loading with dynamic imports and `<svelte:component>`
- Use `$derived()` for expensive computations to avoid unnecessary recalculations
- Use `$derived.by()` for complex derived values that require multiple statements
- Avoid `$effect()` for derived state - it's less efficient than `$derived()`
- Leverage SvelteKit's automatic code splitting and preloading
- Optimize bundle size with tree shaking and proper imports
- Profile with Svelte DevTools to identify performance bottlenecks
- Use `$effect.tracking()` in abstractions to conditionally create reactive listeners

### Error Handling

- Implement `+error.svelte` pages for route-level error boundaries
- Use try/catch blocks in load functions and form actions
- Provide meaningful error messages and fallback UI
- Log errors appropriately for debugging and monitoring
- Handle validation errors in forms with proper user feedback
- Use SvelteKit's `error()` and `redirect()` helpers for proper responses
- Track pending promises with `$effect.pending()` for loading states

### Testing

- Write unit tests for components using Vitest and Testing Library
- Test component behavior, not implementation details
- Use Playwright for end-to-end testing of user workflows
- Mock SvelteKit's load functions and stores appropriately
- Test form actions and API endpoints thoroughly
- Implement accessibility testing with axe-core

### Security

- Sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS attacks
- Use `@html` directive carefully and validate HTML content
- Implement proper CSRF protection with SvelteKit
- Validate and sanitize data in load functions and form actions
- Use HTTPS for all external API calls and production deployments
- Store sensitive data securely with proper session management

### Accessibility

- Use semantic HTML elements and proper heading hierarchy
- Implement keyboard navigation for all interactive elements
- Provide proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- Ensure color contrast meets WCAG guidelines
- Test with screen readers and accessibility tools
- Implement focus management for dynamic content

### Deployment

- Use environment variables for configuration across different deployment stages
- Implement proper SEO with SvelteKit's meta tags and structured data
- Deploy with appropriate SvelteKit adapter based on hosting platform

## Implementation Process

1. Initialize SvelteKit project with TypeScript and desired adapters
2. Set up project structure with proper folder organization
3. Define TypeScript interfaces and component props
4. Implement core components with Svelte 5 runes
5. Add routing, layouts, and navigation with SvelteKit
6. Implement data loading and form handling
7. Add styling system with custom properties and responsive design
8. Implement error handling and loading states

## Common Patterns

- Renderless components with slots for flexible UI composition
- Custom actions (`use:` directives) for cross-cutting concerns and DOM manipulation
- `{#snippet}` blocks for reusable template logic within components
- Type-safe context with `createContext()` for component tree state sharing
- Progressive enhancement for forms and interactive features with `use:enhance`
- Server-side rendering with client-side hydration for optimal performance
- Function bindings (`bind:value={() => value, setValue}`) for two-way binding
- Avoid `$effect()` for state synchronization - use `$derived()` or callbacks instead
